# RealEstateWebsite-Brick to Roof
Check out the Online Real Estate Website that I created during my Software Development Internship using the Tech stack- Angular 4, Hibernate, Spring Rest, Oracle, HTML, CSS, Typescript.
(The code is not shared due to Company's discretion and policies)
The presentation can be referred for Ideas on creating Full Stack projects on your own. Feel free to go through the slides and understand the Scalable and User Friendly Web Application Layout for the Real Estate Website.
